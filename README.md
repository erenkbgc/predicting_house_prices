# predicting_house_prices
This project aims to predict house sale prices using the Ames Housing dataset. Through comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and data preprocessing, we build a robust regression model. The goal is to minimize prediction error using RMSLE, while providing insights into key factors influencing house prices."
